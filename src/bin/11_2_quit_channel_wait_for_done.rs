//! Based on Go example
//! [slide 38: "Receive on quit channel"](https://talks.golang.org/2012/concurrency.slide#38)
//!
//! How do we know it's finished? Wait for it to tell us it's done. However, this is where we
//! diverge from the Go example. Because Rust async tasks are futures we can wait for the task to
//! exit by calling `await` on the
//! [JoinHandle](https://docs.rs/async-std/1.2.0/async_std/task/struct.JoinHandle.html)
//! returned by `task::spawn`.
//!
//! We can also obtain a final value from the `JoinHandle` too.
//!
//! Finally, in the previous example we sent an explicit message on the quit
//! channel. But we don't really need to send a message. When all senders have
//! been dropped the receiver will shut down naturally.
